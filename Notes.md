# Task manager 

I like to automatize tasks, after tests Grunt and others, I finally came with Gulp,
it's my favourite one for now, and I have some boiler code with it. 

# Angular UI Router

With Spottinstyle, I had the chance to go with the default Angular Router, or Angular UI Router. 
After some research and playing a bit with both, I prefered Angular UI Router because I had more flexibility. 

# CSS Frontend

Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, Foundation.. It doesn't matter at all, depends for what. 
In this case we're doing a basic search, and looks like Google Material fits well.
