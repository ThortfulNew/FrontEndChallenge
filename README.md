* Now you will see a list with the found repositories
    1) click on the repository name to open the issues detail
    2) click on the owner name to open their github page

* The issues view is quite similar

## Other comments

I hope you appreciate the JavaScript part more than the UI :)

I feel this is still in early development and could do with more functionality and details, but hopefully it shows enough of my coding style. 

Also, some parts may not follow any standard, I have been "testing new paths".


# Thortful Front End Fever

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is! Write a JavaScript / Coffeescript app using AngularJS that will allow a user to search a repository by name and display a repository's relevant information such as URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc.

Also, display the available issues of a repository in a separate section in the UI:

* Implement the best design possible for the user interface - search and search results, and issues section.
* You can use Twitter Bootstrap and any JavaScript libraries to support AngularJS (Underscore etc).
* Use best practices in writing JavaScript / Coffeescript, CSS, and HTML.
* Write clearly and use proper MVC structure to write the application.

Bonus: Add another section for visualisation chart (using a JavaScript charting library that you already know) for the number of forks, open issues, stargazer count, watchers count, or any relevant information about the repository.

Few useful URLs:
* Sample API URL to search by repository name	https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=bootstrap
* API URL to display issues of a repository name	https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:username/reponame
* Example: Display Issues of Bootstrap	https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:twbs/bootstrap
* API Documentation	https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues
* GItHub Search API Documentation	https://developer.github.com/v3/search/ 

We could be sneaky and not say anything else, but here's some things we're looking to see:

* An app we can try :)
* Use of existing open source libraries
* Something not looking like a web site from 1993s, We do like how the internet looks today :)

### Submission notes
