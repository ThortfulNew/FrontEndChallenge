# Thortful Front End Fever

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is! Write a JavaScript / Coffeescript app using AngularJS that will allow a user to search a repository by name and display a repository's relevant information such as URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc.

Also, display the available issues of a repository in a separate section in the UI:

* Implement the best design possible for the user interface - search and search results, and issues section.
* You can use Twitter Bootstrap and any JavaScript libraries to support AngularJS (Underscore etc).
* Use best practices in writing JavaScript / Coffeescript, CSS, and HTML.
* Write clearly and use proper MVC structure to write the application.

Bonus: Add another section for visualisation chart (using a JavaScript charting library that you already know) for the number of forks, open issues, stargazer count, watchers count, or any relevant information about the repository.

Few useful URLs:
* Sample API URL to search by repository name	https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=bootstrap
* API URL to display issues of a repository name	https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:username/reponame
* Example: Display Issues of Bootstrap	https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:twbs/bootstrap
* API Documentation	https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues
* GItHub Search API Documentation	https://developer.github.com/v3/search/ 

We could be sneaky and not say anything else, but here's some things we're looking to see:

* An app we can try :)
* Use of existing open source libraries
* Something not looking like a web site from 1993s, We do like how the internet looks today :)
